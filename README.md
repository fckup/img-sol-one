Secure Use of Phantom Wallet Without Exposing the Private Key
Using Phantom Wallet without exposing the private key is crucial for maintaining security. Instead of storing and using the private key directly in your code, you can leverage Phantom Wallet's browser extension or mobile app to sign transactions securely. This ensures that the private key remains secure within the wallet and is never exposed to your code.

Key Components
Phantom Wallet Integration : Use Phantom Wallet's browser extension or mobile app to sign transactions.
Secure Transaction Signing : Use the @solana/wallet-adapter library to interact with Phantom Wallet.
Backend Communication : Ensure the backend can communicate with the frontend to handle transactions.
User Interface : Build a user-friendly interface using frameworks like React.js or Streamlit.
Security Measures : Implement robust checks for fraud detection, rug pulls, and fake volume using APIs like Helius.
